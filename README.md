# The Odin Project: Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a landing page built as an assignment for The Odin Project's Foundations Course. Its primary goal was to apply all concepts learned in the **Flexbox section** to create a complete webpage layout based on provided design mockups.

## Design Mockups

* **Full Design Mockup:** ![Full Design Mockup](./image-one.png)
* **Color and Fonts Reference:** ![Color and Fonts Reference](./image-two.png)

## Implementation Notes

* **Semantic HTML:** Semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) were **not fully implemented** in this version, as the focus was strictly on achieving the layout using Flexbox.
* **Responsiveness:** This landing page is **intentionally not responsive**, as responsive design was beyond the scope of this particular Foundations curriculum assignment.
