# The Odin Project: Landing Page

This project is a landing page created as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Course Assignment: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page#assignment).

The primary purpose of this project is to apply all the concepts learned in the Flexbox section of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum to build a complete webpage layout.

**Implementation Notes:**

* **Semantic HTML:** Please note that semantic HTML elements (such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) have not been fully implemented in this version of the landing page. The focus of this project was primarily on achieving the layout using Flexbox based on the provided design.
* **Responsiveness:** This webpage is intentionally not responsive, as creating a responsive design was beyond the scope and purpose of this specific assignment within the Foundations curriculum.
